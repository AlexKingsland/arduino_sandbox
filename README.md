All my personal Arduino projects and experiments

Projects include:
  - Traffic light timer
      - Implemented on breadboard with green, yellow, red LED
  - Potentiometer tachometer 
      - Code to control a series of green, yellow, red LEDs based off potentiometer's variable resistance
  - Accelerometer testing
      - Control series of LEDs based off accelerometer orientation
  - RFID door lock 
      - Attach a servo to a door lock and wrap an RFID reader to the other side of the door to control the door lock with an RFID chip
  - Self balancing two wheeled robot
      - balance a two wheeled robot using a PID controller
